# ST 558 Course Overview
Since I started my data science journey I always preferred Python as a best tool to do data wrangling and making models out of the dataset. My journey satred analysing  Kaggle's Titanic dataset. That inital step opened up lot of curosity to learn more about data science using Python. This coursework not only helped me in developing a better understandng of data science it also kindled a personal affection toward R programming language.  
After this coursework, I will prefer to utilize powerful R Markdown and R studio for data analysis task. Most importantly I enjoyed learning R Shiny app in R studio. R Shiny apps are very powerfull tool to explain concepts in a very interactive way.

# Future Career Aspect
Data science is a huge field and countinuously developing, and having a good understanding of statical concepts will always help in making good decision from the output of a model. This semester was perfect blend for me, while I learned DOE and statistical test in ST 516 course I utilised those concepts in ST 558 course. In future career aspect I will try to learn more about the CNN, RNN model. I will devote significant time in making R Shiny apps to explain mathematical concepts in a better and interactive way for school kids.
