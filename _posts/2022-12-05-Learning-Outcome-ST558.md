# ST 558 Course Overview
Since I started my data science journey, I always preferred Python as a preferred tool to do data wrangling and model building. My journey in data science domain started by analyzing Kaggle's Titanic dataset and that further it opened a lot of curiosity to learn more about data science using Python. This coursework not only helped me in developing a better understanding of data science it also kindled a personal affection toward R programming language.
After this coursework, I will spend time to utilize powerful R Markdown and R studio for data analysis task. Most importantly I enjoyed learning R Shiny app in R studio and  in future whenever possible I will try to explain my results and outcome to the management in a very interactive way by using R Shiny application.

# Future Career Aspect
Data science is a huge field and continuously developing and having a good understanding of statistical concepts will always help in making good decisions. This semester was perfect blend for me, while I learned DOE and statistical tests in ST 516 course, I utilized those concepts in ST 558 course. In future career aspect I will try to learn more about the CNN, RNN models. I will devote significant time in making R Shiny apps to explain mathematical concepts in a better and interactive way for school kids.
