# Introduction
A model servers three basic purposes, first model should aim to correctly predict an outcome value from a set of predictors. Seconly, a model should be able to explain
the differences in outcome values by differences in exploratory variables. Finally, model should be able to capture the association between the dependent and independent 
variables. Based on the type of required output, generally two type of regression model are often used, near and logistic regression model. Because of linear predictor
and regression coefficients, these model are very popular for any statistical study.
