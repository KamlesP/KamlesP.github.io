# All about Data Science, Statisticians and Machine learning Engineer

Data science domain isn't a newly coined term it has evolved in last 50 years and continuously evolving in 21st century. There has been always debate between the skills, roles and responsibilities a data scientist has to fullfil comparing to a similar domain like a Statistician or a Machine Learning engineer.
A Data scienctist is not just having knowledge of a scripting language such as Python or R, rataher I would consier Data science a broader characterizations of skills.


| Skills | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Programming Skills` | Knowledge of having a scripting laguage is mandatory for a Data scientist. It is good to have programming language like *Python* and *R* and data basequery language like SQL |
| `Statistics` | Having a good understanding of Statistics is a huge advantage. With the ability to understand and carry multiple test before making any decision based on the output of a model will be very helpful and can act as a checker before moving any model to the production server. |
|`Data Visualization`| I consider data visualization as the utmost sill for a data scientist. While working as an intern at Bsoch, I realise that the it is equally important to convey your outcomes and finding to your higher manager. Currently, most of the comapny use PowerBi, Tableau and Alteryx for data visualizatin and reporting. |
|`Machine Learning`| Understanding of Supervised and Unsupervised learning and tools such as K-means, SVM, Dimensionality Reduction, CNN, and RNN will be helpful in considering a model for the project.|
